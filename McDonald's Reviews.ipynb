I mean seriously... how lazy can you get!!!! I worked at McDonalds in Texas when I was 17 for about 8 months and I guess I was spoiled with good management. This was absolutely ridiculous. I was beyond disappointed.   \n",

Been working in this area for 3 years now and gone to this location many times for drive-through pickup. Service is always fast, food comes out right, and the staff is extremely warm and polite.   \n",

I needed to use the restroom  facilities  and the women's bathroom didn't have soap, the floor was wet,  the bathroom stink, and the toilets were nasty. This McDonald's is very nasty.   \n",

It was well manged before. Now it's OK. The parking can be tight sometimes. Like all McDonald's, prices are getting expensive.   \n",

Even though it is still fast food, the service at the drive-thru is the best. They rarely make a mistake and I never see anyone parked in the drive-thru slots where they bring food out because they don't have it ready. So, if you like McDonald's fast food, it doesn't get any better than this.   \n",
